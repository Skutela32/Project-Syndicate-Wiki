# Tuning - How to Tune

## Overview
Tuning allows you to adjust your vehicle's performance and handling. A good tune can improve speed, traction, and control, while a bad tune can cause instability and wheelspin.

## Requirements
- A vehicle
- Access to a tuning menu or tuning location
- (Optional) Tuner chip / tuning laptop

## How It Works
Tuning changes vehicle performance values such as acceleration, traction, gearing, boost pressure, and throttle response.

Some vehicles benefit more from tuning than others depending on weight and drivetrain type.

## How To Use
1. Bring your vehicle to a tuning location.
2. Open the tuning menu.
3. Adjust settings carefully.
4. Test drive the car.
5. Fine tune until the vehicle feels stable.
6. Save your tune.

## Tips / Notes
- Small adjustments can make a big difference.
- Drift tunes reduce grip and increase sliding ability.
- Off-road tunes focus on stability and traction rather than speed.
